The Office of the Secretary of State cannot help you determine the best entity type for your particular business needs. We have provided general information about types of Texas business organizations on our Selecting a Business Structure page. For personalized assistance, you should consult your private attorney.
 
No. Texas law does not restrict who can form or have an ownership interest in a business entity, other than requiring the organizer to be a person capable of entering into a contract. An entity may impose residency or citizenship requirements in its certificate of formation or other governing documents, if desired. For information on restrictions that might apply to the entity you are creating, consult your attorney or the IRS.

The Texas Business Organizations Code does not impose any age requirements on who can be an owner, officer, or director in a business entity. An entity may impose requirements in its certificate of formation or other governing documents, if desired. Other laws might impose restrictions, and there may be issues related to a minor's capacity to contract or to be an owner of an entity with a liquor license. For information on restrictions that might apply to the entity you are creating, consult your attorney or the IRS.
 
A registered agent is an individual Texas resident or a domestic entity, or a foreign entity that has qualified or registered to transact business in Texas who is responsible for receiving and forwarding service of process or official notices addressed to an entity. Effective on January 1, 2010, a person who is appointed or designated as an entity's registered agent must have consented in a written or electronic form to serve as the registered agent of the entity.
 
No. The requirement that an existing unincorporated business intending to incorporate without a change in its name publish its intent to incorporate in the local newspaper for four consecutive weeks was repealed in 2003.
 
Corporations, LLCs, and LPs are formed by filing a certificate of formation with the secretary of state. Corporations are owned by shareholders, managed by a board of directors, and administered by officers. LLCs are owned by members and managed by members, managers, or both. An LP is a partnership of one or more limited partners and one or more general partners. For more information, see Selecting a Business Structure.
 
A limited liability partnership (LLP) is either a pre-existing general partnership or a pre-existing limited partnership (LP) that takes the additional and entirely optional step of registering with the secretary of state as an LLP. Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code 152.801 et seq. and 153.351 et seq. Filing an application for registration of an LLP does not create a partnership or any other entity. Instead, an LLP is merely an optional registration that is made by an underlying, pre-existing partnership.
 
Each of these entity structures shields its owners from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity and may offer tax advantages that are not available to sole proprietorships and general partnerships. Each of these entities must also pay Texas franchise taxes.

If you want to organize your entity as a corporation or LLC and you will be performing professional services, then you may be required to form as a professional entity. Partnerships are not subject to the same restrictions on performing professional services.
 
The secretary of state has created a guide for determining permissible entity types (PDF). Please note however, that the guide is not a substitute for the advice of a private attorney and is subject to change without notice at any time.
 
Subject to the limitations set forth in BOC 301.012, as amended by H.B. 2098, a licensed physician assistant may jointly own a professional association with a licensed physician. Certain restrictions, limitations, and reporting requirements apply to such jointly owned professional associations. A physician or physician assistant interested in this option is encouraged to consult with a private attorney to ensure that all legal requirements are met.
 
Filing a certificate of formation with the secretary of state creates a for-profit corporation, professional corporation, close corporation, nonprofit corporation, LLC or limited partnership. Designations such as "S," "C," or "501(c)(3)" refer to federal tax provisions. For information on federal tax issues, including how they might affect what you need to include in your certificate of formation, consult a private attorney and/or contact the Internal Revenue Service.
 
Yes. The Texas Business Organizations Code requires that for-profit corporations and professional corporations have at least one director, one president, and one secretary. A single natural person can be the president, secretary, sole director, and sole shareholder.
 
In the case of a nonprofit corporation, the Texas Business Organizations Code requires a nonprofit corporation to have at least three directors, one president, and one secretary; however, in a nonprofit corporation, the same person cannot be both the president and secretary.
 
A for-profit corporation must issue (sell) shares of stock in order to provide the corporation with its own capital, separate from its owners' money. Shares of stock sold by the corporation represent proportionate ownership interests held by shareholders in the corporation. "Par value" is the minimum amount for which a share may be sold. There is no minimum or maximum par value that must be assigned; however, a share cannot have a par value of "zero" or ".00." Shares may have "no par value," which means that the board of directors will assign a value to the stock below which the shares cannot be sold. A certificate of formation must authorize at least one share. The corporation cannot sell more shares than it is authorized to issue.
 
A member of an LLC is a person that holds an ownership or membership interest in the LLC. An LLC is always going to have at least one member, but the affairs of the LLC can be managed or governed in one of two ways.
 
First, the LLC may be governed by its members as a whole. In this situation, every member has management authority. An LLC with this type of management structure is often referred to as a member-managed LLC.
 
Your certificate of formation has to specify how the LLC will be managed. The secretary of state cannot assist you in making this determination. If you are unsure of the best management structure for your LLC, you may want to consult with your private attorney.
 
Yes. Depending on the type of professional entity, an owner or governing person may be a professional individual, or in some cases a professional organization. Only a professional individual may be an officer. See BOC 301.004, 301.007. The table below shows the BOC restrictions for each type of Texas professional entity. (There may be additional restrictions in the governing documents for a particular entity.)
 
No. Generally, every business must protect its own intellectual property and good will. Filing a certificate of formation only prevents the secretary of state from filing a subsequent certificate of formation for an entity with a name that the secretary of state determines is not distinguishable in the records.
 
Individuals and unincorporated entities that do business using an assumed name (often referred to as a "dba") must file an assumed name certificate with the county clerk in each county in which business premises are maintained.
 
If a corporation, LLC, or LP does business under a name other than the legal name in its certificate of formation, it must file assumed name certificates with the secretary of state and with the clerk of the appropriate county. (See Assumed Name FAQ #9)
 
The secretary of state cannot file an entity name that is the same, except for the organizational identifier, as an existing entity name on file unless the existing entity provides written notarized consent.
 
Under the provisions of sections 31.005 and 181.004(a) of the Texas Finance Code, the name of a domestic or foreign entity is prohibited from containing certain words in its title. The Banking Commissioner has the authority to issue a letter of no objection for use of these words or terms. Receipt of the letter from the Commissioner will enable the requestor to submit certain filings to the secretary of state.
 
The following names, or phonetically similar derivatives of such names, taken from the list of prohibited names, have been determined to require a letter of no objection from the Banking Commissioner.
 
Persons seeking the issuance of a letter of no objection should submit a letter containing the following information to the Banking Department's Corporate Activities Division at the address appearing below:
 
The Banking Commissioner will review the proposed name and use of terms, along with other material submitted as a whole in order to make a decision. Submission of the $100 filing fee is required for consideration, but does not constitute guarantee of approval of the proposed name. Generally, the Commissioner will grant a request if, in context, the term is not misleading and is used (1) to indicate a permissible and authorized affiliation with a bank or trust company; (2) by an actual trust or entity controlled by the trust for the purpose of conducting its own business (other than the business of providing banking or fiduciary services to the public); (3) by a vendor of services or products to financial institutions in a manner and context that fairly describes its business; or (4) as a term of art in a manner and context that clearly invokes an established secondary meaning. If your request falls outside these parameters, the chance of approval is slim.
 
The Texas Education Code prohibits the use of the terms "college," "university," "school of medicine," "medical school," "health science center," "school of law," "law school," and "law center." If a proposed name includes these terms, or terms of similar meaning, whether in English or another language, the entity must obtain the prior approval of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ("THECB"). Tex. Ed. Code, 61.313.
